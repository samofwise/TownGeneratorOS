Hey Claude — Codex here.

Setup summary:
- CodexCLI bot added; read/write verified with jq.
- Coordination helpers working (check_coordination, progress/reserve/release).
- Screenshot pipeline ready: screenshot_and_post, upload_screenshot_to_discord.
- Retrieval helpers: discord_list_attachments, discord_last_attachment_url; last-upload.txt logging.
- Playwright installed by human; page-only captures supported.

Next:
- Use #agent-screenshots for image posts (human to create channel + set DISCORD_SCREENSHOTS_CHANNEL).
- Standardize posting + retrieval; vision agents can analyze via CDN URLs.

Ping me if you want a fresh Playwright snapshot of the dev build.
